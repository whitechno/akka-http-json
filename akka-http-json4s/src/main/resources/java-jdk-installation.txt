== Determining the Default Version of the JDK

    You can determine which version of the JDK is the default by typing
    % java -version or $ javac -version
    in a Terminal window. If the installed version is 8u6, you will see a string
    that includes the text 1.8.0_06. For example:

    % java -version
    java version "1.8.0_06-ea"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_06-ea-b13)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.2-b04, mixed mode)

    To run a different version of Java, either specify the full path, or use the java_home tool:

    % /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8.0_06 --exec javac -version

    For more information, see the java_home(1) man page.

== Installing the JDK
   at the Oracleâ€™s Java 8 download page
   https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

== Uninstalling the JDK
   To uninstall the JDK, you must have Administrator privileges and execute the remove command
   either as root or by using the sudo(8) tool.

   Navigate to
   /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines
   and remove the directory whose name matches the following format:
   /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdkmajor.minor.macro[_update].jdk

   For example, to uninstall 8u6:

   % rm -rf jdk1.8.0_06.jdk

   Do not attempt to uninstall Java by removing the Java tools from /usr/bin.
   This directory is part of the system software and any changes will be reset
   by Apple the next time you perform an update of the OS.
